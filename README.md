This is a game about memorizing street names. Currently made for Potsdam.

The page is built with Next.js and Tailwind. The map is built with OpenLayers.

## How to play

There are two modes:

1. "Next task (on map)" highlights a street on the map which you have to name.
2. "Next task (street name)" gives you a street name which you have to point to on the map.
